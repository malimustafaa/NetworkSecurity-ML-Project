## Phishing Detection - Machine Learning Project 

The aim of the experiments conducted in this project is to present an idea of how modern phishing website attacks can be prevented using machine learning. To do this, we are going to use the Phishing Websites' Dataset. The viewers are requested to take a look at this paper by the authors of the dataset. The paper discusses the data generation strategy in details and how the authors were able to come up with the most significant set of features for detecting phishing websites.
